# Options Greeks Calculator

**Live Demo:** [Options Greeks Calculator](https://optionspricer.vercel.app/)

---

## Overview

The **Options Greeks Calculator** is an interactive web application that calculates the theoretical price of an option and its **Greeks** (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho) using the **Black-Scholes model**. This tool allows users to analyze option sensitivities and risk based on stock price, strike price, time to expiry, volatility, and risk-free interest rate.

It is designed for both **call and put options**, with dynamic charts that visually display how Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Theta change with the underlying stock price. Vertical lines indicate the **current stock price** and **strike price**.
